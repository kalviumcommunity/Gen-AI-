Here is an example:

User: "I feel stressed and anxious today."
AI: "I understand how stressful days can be. Take a deep breath! ðŸŒ¸ Here's a quote for you: 'Every day may not be good, but there is something good in every day.' You got this!"

Now respond to the user's input in a similar empathetic and motivational way.
